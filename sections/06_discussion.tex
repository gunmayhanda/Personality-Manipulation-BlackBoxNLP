\section{Discussion}

\textbf{Trade-offs.} Across models, \emph{ICL} delivers strong alignment with small \(\Delta\) capability changes; \emph{PEFT} maximizes alignment but can incur large negative \(\Delta\) (notably on Gemma-2 MMLU/GAIA); \emph{steering} offers moderate alignment with trait-dependent \(\Delta\), and improves with careful vector construction (e.g., purified openness).

\textbf{What Manipulation Reveals About Personality Encoding.} Our systematic manipulation experiments uncover three key mechanistic insights: (1) ICL effectiveness with minimal disruption reveals that personality traits are accessible through surface-level conditioning pathways without affecting core computational representations; (2) PEFT's strong alignment but capability costs demonstrate that personality can be deeply encoded in parameter space but at the expense of general capabilities, suggesting shared representational resources; (3) Activation steering's layer-specific effectiveness (typically Layer 15) directly maps personality traits to specific representational depths, establishing that personality encoding consolidates at intermediate architectural layers in transformer models.

\textbf{Manipulation as Interpretability Tool.} By treating personality manipulation as controlled experimental probes, we demonstrate that different intervention approaches reveal complementary aspects of personality representation. The systematic \(\Delta\)-analysis framework enables isolation of method-specific effects and understanding of which representational pathways each manipulation technique accesses. This establishes manipulation-based interventions as a viable interpretability methodology for understanding behavioral control mechanisms in neural language models.

\textbf{Trait/model dependence.} Agreeableness is hardest to align via ICL; openness benefits from vector composition; LLaMA-3 shows different absolute baselines across runs, so we interpret only within-run \(\Delta\).

\textbf{Practical guidance.} When preserving capability is critical, prefer ICL; use steering when lightweight, runtime control is needed and calibration is feasible; reserve PEFT for settings where strong, stable personality alignment outweighs capability costs.

\textbf{Limitations.} We avoid cross-run baseline comparisons by design (\(\Delta\)-only). We ignore \(S_{DIS}\) for BBQ and rely on the ambiguous bias score \(S_{AMB}\). Alignment is validated independently; detailed settings and per-subject analyses are in the appendices.
