\section{Comparative Analysis}
\label{app:comparative-analysis}

We qualitatively compare methods using the \(\Delta\)-based results and alignment validation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prompting: strong alignment, small capability \(\Delta\); minimal infrastructure.
\item PEFT: strongest alignment, often negative capability \(\Delta\) on Gemma-2; training required.
\item Steering: moderate alignment, trait-dependent capability \(\Delta\); lightweight and reversible.
\end{itemize}
